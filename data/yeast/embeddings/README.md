# Yeast Embeddings

Included are yeast embeddings generated using the GO subset and annotations included in ```/data/yeast/datasets/```.
Three different methods of generating embeddings are used, as discussed in the Onto2Vec paper:
- ```vectors_add_<>.lst``` files are generated by first generating embeddings of GO classes. Then, the *sum* of all the embeddings of classes to which a protein is annotated to is taken as the protein's embedding.
- ```vectors_mean_<>.lst``` files are generated by first generating embeddings of GO classes. Then, the *mean* of all the embeddings of classes to which a protein is annotated to is taken as the protein's embedding.
- ```vectors_<>.lst``` files are generated directly from Word2Vec from the set of both GO axioms and annotation axioms.

Embeddings were also generated using three different methods of propagating ancestors:
- ```noancestor``` denotes that only the original protein annotations, as provided in the ```.gaf``` file were used.
- ```singleancestor``` denotes that proteins were additionally annotated with a single layer of ancestors of their original annotations. In other words, proteins were also annotated with the parents of their original classes.
- ```fullancestor``` denotes that proteins were additionally annotated with all ancestors of their original annotations. In other words, annotations were propogated up the full GO tree.
